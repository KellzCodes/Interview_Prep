### Programming Practice
- [PP 2.2](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp22.java) Write a program that reads four integers and prints the sum of their squares.
- [PP 2.3](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp23.java) Write a program that reads three floating point numbers and prints the cube of their average.
- [PP 2.4](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp24.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads a course name, its credits and reference book. Then print the following paragraph, inserting the appropriate data: This semester, a new course on *course_name* has been added to the curriculum. It consists of *credits* credits and the reference book for this course is *reference_book*.
- [PP 2.5](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp25.java) Create a version of the UnitConverter application to convert from inches to foot. Read the inches value from the user.
- [PP 2.6](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp26.java) Write a program that converts grams to pounds. (One pound equals 453.592 grams.) Read the grams value from the user as a floating point value.
- [PP 2.7](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp27.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads integer values for typing speed and number of characters in the document, then prints the time required to type them as a floating point result.
- [PP 2.8](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp28.java) Write a program that reads values representing the weight in kilograms, grams, and milligrams and then prints the equivalent weight in milligrams. (For example, 1 kilogram, 50 grams, and 42 milligrams is equivalent to 10,50,042 milligrams.)
- [PP 2.9](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp29.java) Create a version of the previous project that reverses the computation. That is, read a value representing the weight in milligrams, then print the equivalent weight as a combination of kilograms, grams, and milligrams. (For example, 90,70,056 milligrams is equivalent to 9 kilograms, 70 grams, and 56 milligrams.)
- [PP 2.10](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp210.java) Write a program that determines the value of the coins in a jar and prints the total in dollars and cents. Read integer values that represent the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
- [PP 2.11](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp211.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads a double value representing a monetary amount. Then determine the fewest number of each bill and coin needed to represent that amount, starting with the highest (assume that a ten-dollar bill is the maximum size needed). For example, if the value entered is 47.63 (fortyseven dollars and sixty-three cents), then the program should print the equivalent amount as: 4 ten dollar bills 1 five dollar bills 2 one dollar bills 2 quarters 1 dimes 0 nickles 3 pennies
- [PP 2.12](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp212.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads two integers representing the length and breadth of a rectangle, then prints its perimeter and area.
- [PP 2.13](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter002/Pp213.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads the circumference of a circle as a floating point value (double), then prints the radius of the circle
