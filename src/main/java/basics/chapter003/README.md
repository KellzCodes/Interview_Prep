### Programming Practice
- [PP 3.1](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter003/Pp31.java) Write a program that prompts for and reads the user’s first and last name (separately). Then print a string composed of the first letter of the user’s first name, followed by the first five characters of the user’s last name, followed by a random number in the range 10 to 99. Assume that the last name is at least five letters long. Similar algorithms are sometimes used to generate usernames for new computer accounts.
- [PP 3.2](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter003/Pp32.java) Write a program that prints the sum of cubes. Prompt for and read two integer values and print the sum of each value raised to the third power.
- [PP 3.3](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter003/Pp33.java) Write a program that creates and prints a random phone number of the form XXX–XXX–XXXX. Include the dashes in the output. Do not let the first three digits contain an 8 or 9 (but don’t be more restrictive than that), and make sure that the second set of three digits is not greater than 655. Hint: Think through the easiest way to construct the phone number. Each digit does not have to be determined separately.
- [PP 3.4](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter003/Pp34.java) Write a program that reads a floating point value (**double**) and prints the closest whole numbers less than and greater than that value. For example, if the number is 28.466, the program would print 28 and 29.
- [PP 3.5](https://github.com/KellzCodes/Interview_Prep/blob/main/src/main/java/basics/chapter003/Pp35.java) Write a program that reads the  coordinates for two points. Compute the distance between the two points using the following formula: $`\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 - (y_2-y_1)^2}`$
- [PP 3.6]() $`\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3`$
